royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to 
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the 
Project, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by 
You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by 
combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project to which such 
Contribution(s) were submitted.

4. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP

You acknowledge and agree that:

(a) The Project Owner retains all right, title, and interest in and to the 
Project, including all intellectual property rights therein.

(b) All Contributions become the property of the Project Owner upon submission, 
and the Project Owner shall have sole discretion over the use, modification, 
distribution, and commercialization of the Project and all Contributions.

(c) You waive any "moral rights" or similar rights in Your Contributions to 
the extent permitted by applicable law.

5. NO OWNERSHIP, EQUITY, OR FINANCIAL INTEREST

You expressly acknowledge and agree that:

(a) You shall have no ownership interest, equity stake, or financial interest 
in the Project, any derivative works, or any legal entity formed in connection 
with the Project, regardless of the nature, extent, or value of Your 
Contributions.

(b) Your Contributions do not entitle You to any compensation, royalties, 
profit-sharing, revenue participation, or any other financial consideration, 
whether now or in the future.

(c) In the event the Project is commercialized, sold, licensed, transferred to 
a legal entity, or otherwise monetized in any way, You shall have no claim to 
any proceeds, consideration, or benefits resulting therefrom.

(d) You shall have no claim to founder status, co-founder status, or any 
similar designation with respect to the Project or any entity formed in 
connection with the Project.

(e) Your participation in the Project, whether as part of a bootcamp assignment

relationship, or agency relationship between You and the Project Owner.

(f) You waive any and all claims, whether known or unknown, existing now or 
arising in the future, to ownership, equity, compensation, or any other 
financial or proprietary interest in the Project or its outcomes.

6. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

You represent and warrant that:

(a) You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.

(b) Your Contribution is Your original creation and does not violate any 
third-party intellectual property rights, confidentiality obligations, or other 
rights.

(c) If Your employer or any third-party entity (including any educational 
institution or bootcamp) has rights to intellectual property that You create, 
You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer 
or third-party entity, or Your employer or third-party entity has waived such 
rights for Your Contributions.

(d) Your Contribution does not include any third-party code, materials, or 
content except as explicitly disclosed to the Project Owner in writing at the 
time of submission.

(e) You have reviewed and understand any intellectual property policies of Le 
Wagon or similar educational programs in which You are enrolled, and Your 
submission of Contributions does not violate any such policies.

7. CONFIDENTIALITY

You agree to maintain in confidence and not disclose to any third party:

(a) Any non-public information about the Project, including but not limited to 
source code, development plans, business strategies, or other proprietary 
information.

(b) Any information designated as confidential by the Project Owner.

(c) Any information that would reasonably be understood to be confidential 
given its nature and the circumstances of disclosure.

This confidentiality obligation shall survive for a period of three (3) years 
following termination of Your participation in the Project or public disclosure 
of such information by the Project Owner, whichever occurs first.

8. LIMITED NON-COMPETE

During Your active participation in the Project and for a period of six (6) 
months following Your last Contribution, You agree that You shall not:

(a) Directly use confidential information, proprietary code, or trade secrets 
obtained through Your participation in the Project to develop or launch a 
directly competing product or service that replicates the core functionality 
and purpose of the Project.

(b) Misappropriate the Project's source code, documentation, or other 
proprietary materials to create a derivative work that competes with the 
Project.

This provision shall not prohibit You from:

(i) Working on or contributing to general software projects in related fields 
or industries;

(ii) Developing projects that share common features with the Project but serve 
different purposes or markets;

(iii) Using generally available skills, knowledge, and experience gained 
through Your participation;

(iv) Contributing to open-source projects or other bootcamp projects;

(v) Pursuing employment, freelance opportunities, or entrepreneurial ventures 
in related technology areas;

(vi) Building portfolio projects that demonstrate similar technical skills.

For clarity, this limited non-compete is narrowly tailored to prevent 
misappropriation of confidential Project materials and does not restrict Your 
general career development, portfolio building, or participation in the broader 
software development community.

9. NO OBLIGATION TO USE

You acknowledge that the Project Owner is under no obligation to accept, 
include, or use Your Contributions, and may remove or modify Your Contributions 
at any time in the Project Owner's sole discretion.

against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses 
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from or relating to:

(a) Your Contributions;

(b) Your breach of any representation, warranty, or obligation in this 
Agreement;

(c) Any claim that Your Contribution infringes or violates any third-party 
intellectual property or other rights;

(d) Any negligent or wrongful act or omission by You in connection with the 
Project.

IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS

OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF

12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL YOU OR THE PROJECT 
OWNER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR 
PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY 
OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.

THE PROJECT OWNER'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT 
SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00).

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE PROJECT OWNER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER 
(INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS PROFITS, BUSINESS 
INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS) 
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROJECT OR ANY CONTRIBUTIONS, 
EVEN IF THE PROJECT OWNER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

13. FUTURE TRANSFER

You acknowledge and agree that the Project Owner may transfer all rights and 
obligations under this Agreement to a separate legal entity at any time, and 
such entity shall become the successor to all rights granted herein.

principles. The parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts 
located in the State of Delaware for resolution of any disputes.

Owner regarding Your Contributions and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, whether written or 
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

16. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, 
that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary 
so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

voluntary and made with full understanding of the terms of this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the confidentiality provisions in Section 7, You retain the 
right to reference Your participation in the Project on Your resume, LinkedIn

(i) Do not disclose confidential technical details, proprietary source code, or 
business strategies;

(ii) Describe Your contributions in general terms (e.g., "Contributed to a 
dating application using React and Node.js");

(iii) Do not misrepresent Your role or claim ownership of the Project.

18. ACCEPTANCE
