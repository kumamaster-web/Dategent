### For Contributors

**CRITICAL:** By contributing to this project in ANY way, you are automatically and legally bound by the Contributor License Agreement.

#### What Constitutes "Contributing"?

Any of the following actions constitute acceptance of the full terms in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file:
- Submitting a pull request
- Making a commit
- Opening or commenting on an issue
- Submitting code suggestions
- Contributing documentation
- Participating in code reviews

#### Dual Acceptance Mechanism

Contributors must acknowledge and agree to the Contributor License Agreement through **BOTH** of these methods:

1. **Automatic Acceptance via LICENSE File** (PRIMARY - ALWAYS BINDING)
   - The [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file in this repository contains the complete Contributor License Agreement
   - **By submitting any contribution, you automatically accept ALL terms in the LICENSE file**
   - This acceptance is legally binding regardless of whether you explicitly sign via CLA Assistant
   - **You are responsible for reading the LICENSE file before contributing**
   - Ignorance of the LICENSE terms does not exempt you from them

2. **Formal Signature via CLA Assistant** (SUPPLEMENTARY)
   - When you submit your first pull request, CLA Assistant will prompt you to sign
   - This provides additional documentation of your acceptance
   - **However, even if CLA Assistant fails or you don't complete the formal signing process, you are still bound by the LICENSE file terms from the moment you submit any contribution**

#### What This Means

The Contributor License Agreement in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) file requires that you:

- ✅ Grant full copyright license to the Project Owner for your contributions
- ✅ Grant full patent license to the Project Owner for your contributions

**READ THE FULL [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) FILE BEFORE CONTRIBUTING. By contributing, you confirm you have read, understood, and agree to ALL terms.**

#### No Exceptions

- There are no exceptions to the Contributor License Agreement
- Technical issues with CLA Assistant do not exempt you from the LICENSE terms
- Past contributions are covered by these terms
- Future contributions are covered by these terms
- These terms supersede any prior agreements or understandings
